Python Data Analyst Project: Google Apps Analysis
Overview
Welcome to my data analyst portfolio project! In this project, I've analyzed Google Apps data to provide recommendations to app developers. By diving into various factors affecting app success, I aim to guide developers in creating apps with maximum installations and higher success rates.

Project Goals
Analyze Google Apps data to understand factors contributing to app success.
Provide insights and recommendations for app developers to improve their app's performance.
Utilize Python and relevant data analysis libraries for thorough examination of the dataset.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various Google Apps, including details like app category, rating, reviews, size, and more. It serves as the foundation for understanding patterns and trends in app performance.

Analysis Process
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to identify correlations, trends, and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Derive new features or modify existing ones to enhance analysis capabilities.
Statistical Analysis: Utilize statistical methods to validate findings and draw meaningful conclusions.
Visualization: Visualize key insights using graphs, charts, and plots for better understanding.
Recommendations: Based on analysis results, provide actionable recommendations for app developers.
